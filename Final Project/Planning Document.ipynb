    "Understanding that recommender engines are found everywhere online, as well as in the media we consume, we’d like to build a song recommendation system. Different platforms like Pandora and Spotify recommend songs and playlists based on a user’s listening trends. Since we’ve been exposed to numerous types of recommender engines, item based and user based collaborative filters, we’d like to take a hybrid approach. \n",
